Usage:

  * Download this repo locally
  * Follow the instructions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#manifest) starting w/ "1: Open the Extension Management page" and load this directory as an unpacked extension
  * In a new tab, visit https://go/ingress â€” it takes some fiddling, but just typing `go/blah` should also work (WIP)
